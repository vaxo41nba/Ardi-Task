      'Australian GP Qualifying: Max Verstappen claims F1 pole from Carlos Sainz',
    content:
      "Max Verstappen fended off a fierce challenge from the returning Carlos Sainz to maintain his perfect start to the 2024 season in Australian Grand Prix qualifying. ​But there was fresh disappointment for Lewis Hamilton, who failed to make Q3 in his Mercedes and will start 11th for Sunday's 4am race - his worst grid position in Melbourne for 14 years. Verstappen made it three poles from three at the start of the new season with a best lap of 1:15.915 to tee up his pursuit at matching his own record of 10 successive race wins. But the world champion had to overcome Ferrari's impressive Sainz, who has returned to action just two weeks after the appendix surgery which kept him out of the Saudi Arabian GP. The Spaniard was fastest in Q1 and Q2 before Verstappen upped the ante in the decisive final session to secure pole by 0.270s.",

      'We see the main character has been asleep on the sofa: their life is a mess. They go into a scene and someone strictly barks, “[SURNAME OF MAIN CHARACTER THAT THEY HAVE NO OTHER OPPORTUNITY TO EVER INTRODUCE], you’re late!”, so that must mean it’s their boss. Try-too-hard weird banter with someone eating cereal standing up normally means they have a flatmate. Try-too-hard banter with someone else? That normally means best friend. What about a scene where they order coffee and the barista wants them to use different words for coffee than they normally use and it turns into a whole altercation? That means they are ornery (“Just a normal coffee. Black. Thank you”).',

      'Streaming: All of Us Strangers and the best films that revisit childhood',
    content:
      "Itend to be wary of movies talked up as tear-jerkers - going into any film with an expected or prescribed emotional reaction kind of sets the body up to resist. If you've heard anything about Andrew Haigh's All of Us Strangers, it's probably something along those lines. “This film will destroy you,” a colleague told me before I saw it last summer. (Should we be enticed by such a promise?) But then it did: not aggressively or unpleasantly, but by slow degrees, continuing in the weeks and months after I saw it, the memory of it returning and lingering like a deep bruise when my father died last November. Haigh’s artful, unexpected ghost story, now streamable on Disney+ and elsewhere, sensitively presses on a number of psychological sore points: grief, loneliness and queer anxiety among them. But they’re all bound by that most reliable of sources for cinematic pathos: the adult revisitation of childhood – in this case a literal one, as Andrew Scott’s trauma-burdened protagonist returns to his childhood home in Dorking, only to find his parents – killed in a car crash when he was a boy – living there, seemingly alive and well, practically the same age as he is now. It’s a supernatural leap that enables a rich, anguished reflection on the selves we leave behind as we grow up, and how they might communicate with each other. Would the younger you, to say nothing of your younger parents, recognise the older you?",

      "'End of the world vibes': why culture can't stop thinking about apocalypse",
    content:
      "It is a sunny afternoon in Taormina, Sicily, and two wealthy couples on holiday are drinking Aperol spritz on a balcony overlooking the sea. Harper, who runs on anxiety and guilt, says she has trouble sleeping because of “everything that’s going on in the world”. Daphne, who runs on pleasure and denial, asks what she means. “Oh, I don’t know,” says Harper. “Just, like, the end of the world.” Daphne laughs. “Oh no, Harper! The world’s not ending, it’s not that bad.” She doesn’t follow the news any more. “And even if it was as bad as they say it is, I mean what can you really do, you know?” Harper and Daphne are sitting on the same beautiful hotel balcony, drinking the same expensive drinks, but only one of them is tormented by the sense that we are all doomed. “It's like we're all entertaining each other while the world burns,” says Harper. This is a scene from season two of the HBO series The White Lotus, starring Aubrey Plaza as Harper and Meghann Fahy as Daphne. The show leaves open the question of whether Harper’s position is a morally responsible reaction to vast and dangerous problems or a yelp of impotent despair. “Such convictions in the mouths of safe, comfortable people playing at crisis, alienation, apocalypse and desperation, make me sick,” complains the protagonist of Saul Bellow’s 1964 novel Herzog. “We must get it out of our heads that this is a doomed time, that we are waiting for the end, and the rest of it … Things are grim enough without these shivery games … We love apocalypses too much.”",

      'Out of control media left Kate with little choice over opening up about health',
    content:
      'When she met Prince William, the heir to the British throne, more than 20 years ago at St Andrews University, Catherine, the Princess of Wales had her first taste of the appetite for news about her life and her budding romantic involvement with the young prince. Since their marriage in 2011, the desire for news, any news, about Catherine has only grown. Her every movement has been tracked, every outfit remarked upon, every decision – around her work, her children, the way she spends her free time, the way she moves – has been endlessly analysed, assessed, lauded or judged. The most famous woman in the UK is, one imagines, used to the attention – even if it is endured, rather than enjoyed. But it is unlikely that anything can have prepared her, and those who love her, for the 24-hour a day, seven days a week onslaught of speculation that the princess has faced since it was announced in January that she had undergone abdominal surgery. Catherine and William have tried to keep this very personal, intensely difficult time for their family private. But that was made impossible by the tornado of rumours and conspiracy theories reaching incredible force – in the traditional press, digital media and on social media.',

      'Speculation about who carried out the shooting at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow has quickly indicated that the terror attack will have outsized political implications in Russia and abroad. A claim has surfaced that the attack was carried out by Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) a regional affiliate of the IS terrorist organisation. IS has been implicated in some of Russia’s largest recent terror attacks, including the 2017 bombing in the St Petersburg metro that killed 15 and injured 45.

      'Rishi Sunak urged to rethink decision to keep £10m Frank Hester donation',
    content:
      'Rishi Sunak has been urged to rethink the decision to keep £10m from the Conservative donor Frank Hester after police said they were investigating “racist comments which were allegedly made” by the businessman in 2019. The investigation by West Yorkshire police was triggered by a complaint from Diane Abbott, after the Guardian reported that Hester told colleagues that looking at the MP made you “want to hate all black women” and said she “should be shot”. Labour said Sunak should “do what he should have done a fortnight ago: pay back the money”, while a Conservative donor, Dr Maurizio Bragagni, said the party should not accept any more money while the investigation is taking place. Abbott said she was “glad” that police were investigating the comments, which were made at a meeting at the offices of Hester’s company in Leeds, adding: “Women in public life should not have to live in fear, so I hope that this investigation is brought to a speedy conclusion.”',

      'The Middle-Aged Serial Action Murder Epic has been one of the most popular movie types of the last 50 years. These films tend to have the same basic setup, which is middle-aged men repeatedly murdering the thing they’re anxious about. For many years this was simply Nazis. A group of men, occasionally disguised in Nazi uniforms – nuance: fear that deep down they actually are Nazis – slaughter thousands of endlessly replicating Nazi soldiers and everyone feels good about this.',

      '“Time passes quickly and you’re happy and sad at the same time because it will all be over soon,” Rodrygo says with a maturity that belies his 23 years. The Real Madrid and Brazil forward has had to grow up quickly and no longer has the air of a youngster. Now he is the one who has to welcome the younger players into the Seleção squad. “You have to be more focused and work harder to make history,” he says as we speak before Brazil’s game against England at Wembley on Saturday. “There are times when I think: ‘Damn it, I’m no longer the youngest in the team.’ When there are jokes, I’m no longer the first in line because there are younger players than me. But I can say I’m happy to have this experience. Even though I’m so young, I’m already treated like a mature person and I help the newcomers as much as I can.”',
